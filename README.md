# STM32F4HUB

- Support to all HID interfaces ([STM32CubeIDE](https://github.com/rtek1000/STM32F4HUB/blob/master/README.md#stm32cubeide-project)).
- - To recognize the Mini Keyboard with built-in touchpad
- - - This project can serve as a basis for other devices with multiple interfaces
- - - - To do: Update HID project from ASC project (it stopped recognizing the multimedia keyboard)

## STM32F4HUB - Original info

Add USB Hub support to your STM32F4 project. Based on STM32Cube Library

* Support to Full speed and low speed usb devices through a hub. 
* Support to all hid interfaces.
* Easilly portable to others STM32Fx microcontrollers

* Ready to be opened and compiled with AC6 IDE

It's ready to run on a STM32F4DISCOVERY development board. You just need a Micro-AB to Type A usb cable.
