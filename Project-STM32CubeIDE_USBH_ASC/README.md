Note:
- Do not use the Device Configuration Tool Code Generator
- - Parts of the core code have been changed outside of the automatic generation delimiters

- ToDo: Check if keyboard accepts LED control, Mini Keyboard crashes when sending control data (USB HID Report Descriptor).
- - Temporarily (until a better solution is implemented using the Report Descriptor), if a Mouse interface is recognized, the keyboard LED update function is disabled for this device (usbh_hid.c file)
